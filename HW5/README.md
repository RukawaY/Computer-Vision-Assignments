# How to Run

Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-213-generic x86_64)

Firstly make sure you have **python3** installed.

In order to run the program, simply run the `run.sh` script.

```bash
bash run.sh
```

The script will first create a virtual environment and install the dependencies. Then it will run the program:

```bash
python -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python mnist_recognition.py
```

# Examples and Results

I have provided 4 images in the root directory:

- `test_images.png`: demonstration of test images, 16 images in total and shaped 4x4.
- `train_images.png`: demonstration of train images, 16 images in total and shaped 4x4.
- `predictions.png`: demonstration of predictions generated by the program, with prediction labels on the top of the images.
- `loss_accuracy.png`: loss and accuracy curve during training.
